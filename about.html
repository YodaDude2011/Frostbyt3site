    <p>Frostbyt3 was originally formed by 3 friends in 2016 under the name: Terabyt3 Games. The group began planning to make a horror game called "Into the Darkness", but plans fell through very early on into development. Terabyt3 Games reorganized and recycled ideas and early versions of code into a new project: The now defunct "What Reality?" thriller/horror game. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>"What Reality?" went into development and lots of progress was made using the Unity Engine. "What Reality?" even had a completely custom soundtrack recorded by a DJThe game was worked on for about 3 years and then off and on for another year until the game was declared End-Of-Life. During the time of game development, the group grew to around 15 members and rebranded to Terabyt3 Software. When the group started to fall apart in 2018, development slowed on their game. Top ranking members started to have conflicting ideas and interests in what was best for the game and the community itself. 
        Eventually, "What Reality?" stopped getting regular updates and Frostbyt3 Studios was formed to include several projects the group had all been working on. 
        Frostbyt3 Studios was created as an attempt for a moral boost, but it ultimately failed.</p>
    <br> 
    <br>   
    <p>Studios included, Flame Interactive and Jourmungandr Productions. Together, the groups worked on "What Reality?" and "Dwemer of Ash", with each studio working on each of the games respectively. During this period "Dwemer of Ash" was developed off and on and went through multiple different revamps. "What Reality?", on the other hand, was almost completely abandoned and its 0.6 updated was announced with a EOL declaration. Version 0.6 never was realized to the public. 
        Frostbyt3 Software was reformed a year after the studios were dismissed and we now have had several successful projects within FB3, or projects our team has been associated with. </p>
    <br>
    <br>  
    <p> largest and current project is our Frostbyt3 Minecraft SMP. This SMP has a long history and lore with many wars and the rise and fall of great empires and nations. </p>
